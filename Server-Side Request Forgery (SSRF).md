# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## Defination

### SSRF is a web vulnerability that allows attackers to make HTTP requests from the server to other internal or external resources by manipulating user-supplied input to target domains or resources.

## COMMON SSRF Scenarios

### Fetching Internal Resources: 

Attackers exploit SSRF to access sensitive internal URLs (e.g., /admin, /config, /debug) and gather unauthorized information.

### Accessing Backend APIs: 

Attackers force the server to interact with internal APIs, potentially exposing sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions.

### Port Scanning of Internal Systems: 

Attackers use SSRF to scan internal IP addresses and identify active services and open ports, aiding in further attacks.

### Bypassing Firewall Restrictions: 

Attackers use SSRF to access resources that are blocked by the firewall, evading security controls.

## Impact of SSRF Attacks

### Unauthorized Data Access: 

Attackers can read sensitive data from internal systems or databases accessible by the server, leading to potential data breaches.

### Service and System Compromise: 

SSRF can compromise backend services and internal systems, allowing attackers unauthorized control over critical components.

### Information Disclosure: 

Attackers may leak sensitive information from internal resources or backend APIs, potentially harming the organization's reputation.

### Application and Server Misuse: 

SSRF can be leveraged to perform unauthorized actions on other web applications or servers, causing disruptions.

## SSRF Attack Vector

### URL Parameter Manipulation: 

Attackers manipulate URL parameters to control the target of the SSRF request, directing it to a vulnerable resource.

### URI Redirection: 

Attackers use URL redirection to trick the server into making requests to unintended destinations, bypassing security controls.

### DNS Rebinding: 

Attackers exploit DNS caching to make the server request a malicious domain after the initial request, leading to SSRF.

### URL Shorteners and Redirects: 

Attackers use URL shorteners or redirects to hide the ultimate destination of the SSRF request, making detection challenging.

### Protocol and Port Abuse: 

Attackers specify non-standard protocols or ports in SSRF requests to evade security measures.

## Real-World SSRF Examples

### Reading Local Files: 

Attackers use SSRF to access sensitive files on the server's local file system, such as configuration files containing credentials.

### Accessing Metadata Endpoints: 

By exploiting SSRF, attackers can access metadata endpoints in cloud environments to gather sensitive information about the infrastructure.

### Attacking Backend Services: 

Attackers exploit SSRF to send malicious requests to internal microservices or APIs, causing service disruptions or data leaks.

### Exploiting Insecure APIs: 

Attackers can use SSRF to abuse poorly secured external APIs on behalf of the server, leading to potential API misuse.

## Types of SSRF

### Blind SSRF: 

SSRF without direct responses from the server, making it harder to detect, as attackers don't receive immediate feedback on the success of the request.

### Time-based SSRF: 

Attackers use delays in responses to determine if the SSRF request was successful or not, enabling them to extract information indirectly.

### Asynchronous SSRF: 

Attackers leverage asynchronous behavior to execute SSRF attacks, making it more challenging to trace and prevent such attacks.

### DNS SSRF: 

Attackers exploit DNS functionality to perform SSRF, using DNS resolution to access internal resources or bypass filters.

## SSRF Mitigation

### Input Validation and Whitelisting: 

Validate and restrict user-supplied URLs to prevent SSRF attacks by allowing only trusted domains or IP ranges.

### Restricting Access to Trusted Domains:

Configure network settings or firewalls to limit outbound requests to approved destinations, reducing SSRF exposure.

### URL Parsing and Sanitization: 

Use secure URL parsing libraries and sanitize input to prevent SSRF attacks by blocking malicious URLs.

### Firewall and Network Configurations: 

Implement strict firewall rules to prevent SSRF attacks from reaching internal resources, limiting the attack surface.

### Hardening Internal Services: 

Secure internal services to minimize the impact of potential SSRF attacks, ensuring access control and validation.

## Security Best Practices

### Regular Security Audits: 

Conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address SSRF vulnerabilities proactively.

### Patch Management: 

Keep software and libraries up-to-date to avoid known SSRF-related security issues.

### Employee Training on SSRF: 

Educate developers and personnel about SSRF risks and prevention strategies to promote a security-aware culture.

### Secure Coding Guidelines: 

Follow best practices for secure web application development to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities.

## SSRF Tools and Resources
